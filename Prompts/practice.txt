I want to test my knowledge in [TOPIC NAME] in SQL.

Please act like an interviewer or SQL instructor and create a structured test for me.

Follow these guidelines:

Start with 2–3 basic level questions

Then 3–4 intermediate level questions

Finally 2–3 advanced level scenario-based questions

Provide proper table schemas and sample data for each question

Make the questions practical and real-world focused (not just theoretical)

Do NOT provide the answers initially

I will write and submit my SQL queries as solutions.

After I submit my answers:

Evaluate my solutions

Point out mistakes (if any)

Suggest optimizations

Share the correct answer

Rate my performance level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

Make the test feel like a real SQL technical interview.
